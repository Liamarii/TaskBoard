# TaskBoard

## Summary
This project is a task board with with three columns of TODO, DOING and DONE.

## About
The header is an input field which allows users to enter a new task on pressing enter and will create the task in the TODO column.
A task can be dragged to any column or deleted using the remove button within the task.
The height of the task board is dependent on how many tasks are contained but does have a minimum height.
The aim of this project was to build a task board without just pulling in a pre-made angular material.

The project uses the Angular framework and is written in JavaScript with TypeScript type safety with BEM style SCSS.
